📄 Regex Data Extractor
This Python project extracts various data types—such as emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, times, HTML tags, hashtags, and currency amounts—from a given text file using regular expressions.

🚀 Project Overview
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching in text. This project demonstrates how to use them in Python to scan a text file and extract useful information automatically.

📥 How to Use
Clone the repository (or download the folder):

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alu_regex-data-extraction-Jonathan2055.git
cd alu_regex-data-extraction-Jonathan2055
Add your sample text to the sample.txt file.

Make sure it's in the same directory as regex_extractor.py.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
python regex_extractor.py
🧠 How It Works
The script opens and reads the contents of sample.txt using utf-8 encoding.

It then applies multiple regular expression patterns to extract relevant information.

Each type of data is printed to the terminal in a categorized format.
